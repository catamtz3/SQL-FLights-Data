a.	What is one thing that you learned while doing this assignment?
        I learned how to import a database and use it in SQL/SQLite. I'm very new
        at SQL/SQLite and wasn't familiar with the setup of importing a data file in a remote server
        and it took me almost an hour and a half to figure out how to do it properly. Now,
        I know in the future how to import the data and it won't take me almost 2 hours every time. 

b.	What is one thing that surprised you while doing this assignment?
        I was surprised at how specific you can get with large amounts of data. You can be 
        very picky with what and how you want everything sorted, even with a bunch of columns and 
        data pieces. I expected this homework to be simpler due to the size of the data, but I was 
        proven wrong.

c.	What is one question that you still have after doing this assignment?
        Do you always need a where clause even when it seems like you don't need one?
        I was unsure for problem 3 if I needed a where or not since both seemed logical, but yet
        both gave me different results. I trusted my gut and included the where clause but I was unsure 
        if you always need one.
